* Liquid Config
** Included:
1) batteries
2) A very simple timesheet tracker (to someday be it's own repo.
3) Happiness and Joy (peace and goodwill to men).
** Not included:
1) org-mode (yet? maybe)
2) a TODO list
3) a way to create notes and link them together in clojure.
4) Exports to markdown or html or LaTEX like in org-mode
5) (happily?) emacs-lisp
6) clojure (you'll need to install the clj command-line utils, which are easily available in your favorite package manager)
